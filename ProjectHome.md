# Welcome! #

Thank you for visiting our project page. We worked very hard to get this information ready for the end user. All this information is for you.

The origin of this project started 6 months ago with our fist flock of backyard chickens. Life changed dramatically but in a great way. We love our girls and have been able to provide them a happy, healthy living. In return they gift us with eggs everyday.

The basis for this project is an Arduino micro controller project. It is used to monitor and care for the general health of a backyard chicken coop. There are several sensors and interface boards that provide the information from the coop. All the information is displayed on the LCD screen.
